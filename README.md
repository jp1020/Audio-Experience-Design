Maxmsp patch for PORTALS: an immersive audio installation that simulates daydreaming

'Simplewindow.maxpat' is triggered from a master maxpatch that detects when a user's head is turned to face a window. Once activated it plays the audio from outside on an exctier speaker attached to the window. Then the maxpatch dreamlike effects take over and shroud the senses for a nightmarish dream experience.
